    <h2>Block Quotes with &lt;blockquote&gt;</h2>
    <!--
      <blockquote> is used for longer, standalone quotations.
      Browsers often indent or style it differently by default.
    -->
    <blockquote>
      "Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, 
      and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt." 
      <br>- Sun Tzu, The Art of War
    </blockquote>
 
    <h2>Inline Quotes with &lt;q&gt;</h2>
    <p>
      The author wrote,
      <q>practice is the key to mastering web development</q>, which is why
      this project includes many small examples.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Be extremely subtle even to the point of formlessness
      <br>- Sun Tzu, The Art of War
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Abbreviations with &lt;abbr&gt;</h2>
    <p>
      The <abbr title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">IEEE</abbr>
      is a professional association for electronics, electrical engineering, and computer science.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Information with &lt;address&gt;</h2>
    <!--
      <address> is intended for contact information, not just any postal
      address. It is often used inside <footer>.
    -->
    <br/>
    <address>
      My house<br />
      somewhere in the world <br/>
      country: Earth <br/>
      Email: code@gmail.com
    </address>
    <!-- 
      why is there a slash in the <br> tag?
      The <br> tag is a self-closing tag in HTML, which means it does 
      not require a separate closing tag. 
      The slash at the end of <br> is a convention from XHTML, where all tags
      must be closed. In HTML5, you can simply use <br> without the slash, and it will
      still work correctly. The slash is optional in HTML5 and is often included 
      for compatibility with older XHTML syntax.

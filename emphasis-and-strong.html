  TOPIC 4: TEXT FORMATTING & SEMANTICS
  FILE: emphasis-and-strong.html

  WHAT:
    Demonstrates semantic emphasis with <em> and <strong> and compares them
    to purely visual bold/italic created with CSS.

  HOW:
    1. Open this file in your browser.
    2. Compare the "semantic" examples (using <em>/<strong>) with the
       "visual only" examples (using <span> + CSS).
    3. (OPTIONAL) Use a screen reader or accessibility tool to see how
       <em> and <strong> are announced differently.

  WHY:
    - <em> and <strong> express meaning, not just style.
    - Screen readers can use them to change voice or emphasis.
    - CSS-only bold/italic has no semantic meaning by default.

    <h1>Emphasis (&lt;em&gt;) and Strong (&lt;strong&gt;)</h1>

    <h2>Semantic Emphasis</h2>
    <p>
      When you want to stress a word in a sentence, use
      <em>emphasis</em> to show that the word should be read
      with more weight or a different tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      When something is of <strong>great importance</strong>, use
      <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> to indicate that meaning.
    </p>

    <h2>Visual Only (CSS)</h2>
    <p>
      You can make text <span class="visually-italic">look italic</span> or
      <span class="visually-bold">look bold</span> using CSS, but this does
      not convey any extra meaning to assistive technologies.
    </p>

      what is the differnce between span and div, they are both generic elements, 
      but span is inline and div is block-level.

      what do you mean by inline and block-level? 
      Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as
      necessary, while block-level elements start on a new line and 
      take up the full width available.
      so span is for styling a part of a line, 
      while div is for grouping larger sections
    
    -->
    <p>
      The best practice is to use <em>semantic elements</em> first and then
      style them with CSS, instead of using generic elements purely for style.

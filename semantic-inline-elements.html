  FILE: semantic-inline-elements.html

  WHAT:
    Demonstrates several semantic inline elements:
    - <small>, <mark>, <del>, <ins>, <sub>, <sup>

  HOW:
    1. Open this file in your browser.
    2. Observe how each element changes the meaning and appearance of text.
    3. Try editing the examples (e.g. marking different parts as deleted).

  WHY:
    These elements express specific meanings (annotations, changes,
    footnotes, etc.) that help both readers and tools understand your text.

    <h2>&lt;small&gt; for Side Notes</h2>
    <p>
      This paragraph contains a regular sentence.
      <small>This smaller text could be a disclaimer or side note.</small>
    </p>

    <h2>&lt;mark&gt; for Highlights</h2>
    <p>
      You can use <mark>highlighted text</mark> to draw attention to
      important information in a paragraph.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a <mark>very important</mark> point that should not be missed.
    </p>

    <p>
      You shall not pass ! <mark> the above parts carefully.</mark>
    </p>

    <h2>&lt;del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt; for Changes</h2>
    <!-- 
    
      Explain these del and ins tags, 
      
      they are used to show deleted and inserted text, 
      often in the context of editing or version control. Browsers typically render <del> with a 
      strikethrough and <ins> with an underline to visually indicate the changes.

      Version 1: The price is <del>$50</del>
      <ins>$40</ins> today only.
    </p>

    
    <!-- 
    
        wont using del be a bad idea becuase then we will have to edit the html file every time we want to change the price,
        yes, you are correct. Using <del> and <ins> for dynamic content like prices is not ideal because it requires manual updates to the HTML. 
        For dynamic content, it's better to use JavaScript to update the price without needing to edit the HTML structure. 
        The <del> and <ins> tags are more suitable for static content or when you want to show a specific change in a document, 
        such as in a revision history or when tracking changes in a collaborative writing environment.

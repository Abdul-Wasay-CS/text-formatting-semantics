  TOPIC 4: TEXT FORMATTING & SEMANTICS
  FILE: code-and-keyboard.html

  WHAT:
    Demonstrates code-related inline elements:
    - <code> for code fragments
    - <kbd> for user input via keyboard
    - <samp> for program output samples
    - <var> for variables in code or math

  HOW:
    1. Open this file in your browser.
    2. Notice how each element uses a monospace-like style by default.
    3. Imagine how these would appear in documentation or tutorials.

  WHY:
    Using the right semantic elements makes technical documentation
    more readable and easier to scan.

    <h1>Code &amp; Keyboard Elements</h1>

    <h2>&lt;code&gt; for Code Fragments</h2>
    <p>
      Use <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> when referring to code inline, such as
      calling the <code>alert()</code> function in JavaScript.

      this snippet is in code
      <br>  
      <pre>
        <code>
for(int i=0; i&lt;10; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
        </code>
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h2>&lt;kbd&gt; for Keyboard Input</h2>
    <p>
      
      <!-- what does this kbd element do?
      
      It indicates user input from a keyboard.
      this is just a demonstration of the kbd element, which is meant to show keyboard input in documentation. 
      It doesn't actually capture input.
      so its just for formatting text to look like keyboard input, 
      not for real interaction? Exactly! 
      It helps readers understand that the text represents keys they should press.
      why not just use code tag for this? While <code> can be used for code snippets, 
      <kbd> specifically indicates user input, which can help with clarity in instructions.
      so a clear structure for the developer documentation is to use 
      <code> for code examples and <kbd> for instructions on what keys to press? 
      Yes, that's a good practice. It helps differentiate between code and user actions.
      <br>  -->

      To refresh many browsers, press
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> (Windows) or
      <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> (macOS).
    </p>

    <h2>&lt;samp&gt; for Sample Output</h2>
    <p>
      A program might output:
      <samp>Operation completed successfully.</samp>
    </p>

    <h2>&lt;var&gt; for Variables</h2>
    <p>
      In mathematics, the area of a circle is
      <var>A</var> = π × <var>r</var><sup>2</sup>.
